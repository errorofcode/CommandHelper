FARACRY PRIVACY AND POLICY
The following serves as a standard Privacy Policy for bots and mini apps on the Telegram platform.
By design, this policy is written to be generally applicable to a wide range of services. While this document serves as a functional agreement between developers and users, Telegram still encourages all developers to create their own, separate privacy policies to better describe the ways in which their service receives, processes and stores data from its users.

Bot and Mini App Standard Privacy Policy

1.1. Telegram – Telegram Messenger Inc (also “we”).
1.2. Platform – The Telegram Bot Platform.
1.3. Developer – The person or legal entity who operates and maintains Third-Party Service, as further defined in 3.1.
1.4. Third-Party Service – The bot or mini app of Developer, made available to users on Platform.
1.5. User – The person accessing Third-Party Service via their account on Platform (also “you”).
1.6. Policy – This document, governing the relationship between Third-Party Service and User.

2. General Provisions
2.1. Policy is a standard document which applies to all third-party bots and mini apps on Platform by default, unless or until their respective developer has published a separate privacy policy.

2.6. Note that this default Policy is meant to aid Developer in providing a functional privacy policy to their Users, with the understanding that the Policy is written to be generally applicable to a wide range of services. Accordingly, if Developer opts to use the Policy, it is solely their responsibility to ensure that the Policy fits the Developer’s use case and complies with all local laws. 
2.7. If you do not accept all the aforementioned terms, you should immediately cease your use of Third-Party Service.
